# Specific model libraries / Encoders

# For 'hiera':
# The Hiera library by Facebook Research is typically installed from its GitHub repository.
# You might need dependencies like fvcore, iopath, and classy_vision first.
# Example installation steps (consult the official Hiera repository for the latest instructions):
# pip install fvcore iopath classy_vision
# pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/hiera.git
# If 'hiera' is a different library you are using, please adjust accordingly.

# For 'jepa':
# This refers to the V-JEPA model components, likely from a specific research repository
# or a local implementation (e.g., within your 'jepa' directory based on imports like 'from jepa.src...').
# Ensure that this 'jepa' module/package is correctly installed in your Python environment.
# If it's a local package with a setup.py, you might use: pip install -e path/to/jepa_package_root
# Or, ensure the directory containing the 'jepa' top-level folder is in your PYTHONPATH.

# Note: Please verify these versions and installation methods based on the specific requirements
# of the JEPA and Hiera implementations you are using.
